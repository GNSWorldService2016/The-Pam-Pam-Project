			<h2>Web Sites Consulted:</h2> 
			<p>
        	http://www.Seetickets.com/ :
        	On our website we adopted the use of buttons at the top of the web page, this is because the user can clearly see the options available and it makes the page looks neat with good structure. <br />
        	Negative: The left option vertical list is quite boring and long, it would be better to group the categories into a smaller list with a brighter colour
        	Positive: The pictures of links stand out and are very attractive to the user. The buttons show clearly what options are available and both the search bar and the buttons do not change position when any link is clicked which lets the user learn the navigation quickly.<br />

        	http://www.triplecheckaccountants.co.uk/ :
        	From viewing this website we chose to use a central picture below the buttons with information below the picture. This website was simple whilst being easy to use. It clearly showed all the information and the layout was not complicated.
        	Negative: There is only one picture
			Positive: Easy and clear navigation
	        </p>

            
           <h2>Text or Pictures from other Websites:</h2>

           http://www.euro-hostels.co.uk/edinburgh/tourist-information/clubbing -clubs deck picture:
           http://enterteenmentonline.com/?attachment_id=1396 -concert main :
           I have used this picture as the main image which has been placed below the buttons on every page. 
           http://www.oceanaclubs.com/nottingham/tickets-events- Text and pictures in table on “Events” page is from:
           On the “events” page in the table, I have copied the text and images of the events from this website.
	       Consistency: The main heading, picture and buttons appear exactly the same in both colour and look, and are occupying the same space on every page therefore the user will not get confused and will get used to the navigation easily.
	       Alignment: The main heading, “club” picture and the button images are aligned in the centre on the webpage. We chose to do this because in our research of other websites it was common we realised that the web page looked much better and gave a good look to the webpage.
	       Proximity: The heading is first, the button images are below and the picture is below the button images. They are evenly space apart based on their size. There isn’t a very large gap where the user has to keep scrolling, rather it fits neatly in a structured way with enough space in between where it doesn’t look like it is joined.

		  <h2> Colour Scheme:</h2>
		   
		   <p>
          We decided to use a complementary colour scheme with the two colours blue and orange. The background was blue and the text for the main header, the buttons outline, the table border and the form border was orange. The paragraph and headers H2, H3 and H4 were all white in colour. We used white in the paragraphs because we found it easier to read as the orange was a bit bright.
          Blue, orange and white are suitable for colour blind people because when they see blue and orange or blue and white they can see the text because there is a big contrast of colours and therefore see all the words on the page. 
          We used an orange table border to go with our colour scheme to make the table and forms stand out allowing the user to clearly understand and be attracted to register and fill out contact list.

		<h2> Page Design: </h2>
		  
		 
         <h3>Features which remain the same on every page:</h3>
		<p>
	     Main heading h1 “JD Entertainment”<br/>
         There are four buttons which are images<br/>
	     Below the buttons, there is a red-orange picture of a crowd, title=“club”.<br/> <br/>
	     <h4>Contrast:</h4> The main heading is orange and the background is blue. They are complementary and also very different colours from each other and therefore they contrast in this way to allow the user to see it clearly. The buttons are square and filled white images with an orange border, the buttons are clearly seen as there is a big difference between the colours. The orientation is the same throughout for all headings, pictures and buttons, we kept it the same to give the web page more structure. The main heading is size 5em (which is the biggest heading on the page), the buttons are images and the “club” picture is the same size for all web pages.  Therefore using the correct orientation, size and it being the same on every page with a contrasting colour to the background; the main heading, button images and the “club” picture clearly stand out making it visible for the user.<br/>
	     <h4>Consistency:</h4> The main heading, picture and buttons appear exactly the same in both colour and look, and are occupying the same space on every page therefore the user will not get confused and will get used to the navigation easily.<br/>
	     <h4>Alignment:</h4> The main heading, “club” picture and the button images are aligned in the centre on the webpage. We chose to do this because in our research of other websites it was common we realised that the web page looked much better and gave a good look to the webpage.<br/>
	     <h4>Proximity:</h4> The heading is first, the button images are below and the picture is below the button images. They are evenly space apart based on their size. There isn’t a very large gap where the user has to keep scrolling, rather it fits neatly in a structured way with enough space in between where it doesn’t look like it is joined.<br/>
		   </p>
          <br/>
		<br/>	
		<h3>Features which change on each page:</h3>
		 
       <h3> Headings and Paragraphs:</h3>
				
		<p>
		<h4>Contrast:</h4>: The headings h2, h3 and h4 and paragraph p are white and therefore stands out from the blue background, we chose not to make it orange because it was too bright and the paragraphs and all the other headings looked better in white. Reading text was easier on the eyes. The orientation was the same for everything being horizontal. The headings had different sizes making them stand out individually,  h2 was 2em,  h3 was 1.5em and p was 1.1em. <br/>
	   <h4> Consistency:</h4> The colours of the paragraphs are the same because the text is grouped together. h2, h3 and h4 are also the same colour, it shows that they are not the main headers.<br/>
	    <h4>Proximity:</h4> The headers and paragraphs are below each other with a single line break in between. There is enough space between each header and paragraph to show which header belongs to which Paragraph.<br/>
	    <h4>Alignment:</h4> All headers are aligned to the centre of the page, we decided this because it made the header clear to the user. All paragraphs are aligned to the left of the page because when the user reads they will read from left to right, if it were in the centre it will be more confusing and harder to read.<br/>
	    </p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	   
	    <h2>Tickets Page and Contact Us-Mailing List Forms:</h2>
	   
	    <p>
	   <h4>Contrast:</h4> The form is outlined by an orange border. I used the box model to style the fieldset in the form. The orange border attracts the user to the form. The text inside is white and is therefore a big difference to the background blue which makes it easy to view. The orientation is the same throughout being horizontal. The headings are different in size, one being h2 and the other h3, visibly shows the user what the form is about.<br/>
	   <h4>Consistency:</h4> All text which define all the elements in the form are white and are the same size, this is because they are grouped together.<br/>
	   <h4>Proximity:</h4>  The form elements are below each other with line breaks in between. They are not to close keeping a good neat and tidy structure. <br/>
	   <h4>Alignment:</h4> The form is aligned to the centre of the page.<br/>
		</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>	
		
     <h2>Events Page Table:</h2>
		
		<p>
    <h4>Contrast:</h4> The table has an orange border and the text is white. There is a big contrast from the background allowing the user to view the text and headings clearly. The table headings cells are filled with orange making it clearer that they are the headings.<br/>
    <h4>Consistency:</h4> The text is the same size and colour throughout in the paragraphs. The headings are bold.<br/>
    <h4>Proximity:</h4> The text in the table fills the space in the box.<br/>
    <h4>Alignment:</h4> All the text is aligned to the left because the user will read from left to right. The actual table is positioned in the centre.<br/>
